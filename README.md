### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

I prioritized efficiently downloading data, caching the images, and adding the ability to search and bookmark recipes. I focused on these areas because displaying data to the user as quickly as possible is the best use case scenario. Also adding functionality for bookmaking a favorite recipe would make tracking and looking at your favorite recipes much easier.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

2 days. I spent the first day writing down my approach and implementing the basic data models, SwiftUI views, and API data download class. The second day was improving the UI, implementing search functionality, bookmarking a user's favorite recipes through SwiftData, & writing unit tests.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

I would say the biggest trade off I made was from a UI perspective. I wanted to add more in-depth functionality in terms of searching through favorites using SwiftData.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

The weakest part of my project is testing. SwiftData is tricky to test compared to the old XCTest so I ended up creating my own data object for testing purposes.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.

I really enjoyed working on this project. My biggest insight is SwiftData is much more efficient than using CoreData and I would highly suggest using SwiftData for local storage.
